# Python Project

To run the backtest you can go to the `python` directory and run the following command:

```bash
  poetry install
  poetry shell
  cd scripts
  python scripts/run_backtest.py
```

Alternatively, to go over the analysis process you can open Jupyter Notebook located at `python/exercise.ipynb`

# Rust Project

Backtest is also available in Rust. To run the backtest you can go to the `rust` directory and run the following command:

```bash
  cargo run --release
```

Keep in mind that the Rust project will require data preparation steps to be run first. 
So, you should go through the Jupyter Notebook first and run data preparation steps.
