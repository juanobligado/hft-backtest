# Objective
Demonstrate your foundational skills in high-frequency trading (HFT), quantitative analysis, and software engineering by implementing a basic market-making strategy using the HftBacktest framework.

## Data Source
Use the sample tick data provided at https://reach.stratosphere.capital/data/usdm/ for your implementation.

## Task Description
Implement a basic high-frequency market-making strategy for a single crypto trading pair. Your implementation should use HftBacktest (https://github.com/nkaz001/hftbacktest) and include

1. Data Processing:
- Load and preprocess the provided tick data from the given source. - Implement at least one relevant feature for HFT decision-making.

2. Strategy Implementation:
- Develop a simple market-making strategy that adjusts quotes based on order book imbalance.
- Implement basic risk management (e.g., position limits, order size constraints).

3. Latency Simulation:
- Utilize HftBacktest's latency simulation features to model feed and order latencies.
